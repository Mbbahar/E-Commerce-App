# Shopping App

An application example where users can purchase products.<br />

<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="shopping.gif" width=270 height=480></td>
  </tr>
 </table>

Users will be able to see all products in the system collectively on the landing page of the application, and they will be able to filter products by category if they wish. Products will be dynamically filtered by category and updated in the list on the home page. 

If the user goes to the details of any product, she will be able to add the product to the basket or add it to the favorite, remove it from the favorite.

When you go to the "My Cart" screen, the products added to the basket will be displayed collectively and the user will be able to purchase the products. The user will be able to remove any product from the basket. During the purchase, the products will be removed from the basket, the user will be given feedback and the purchase will be recorded in the memory of the phone. Again, on the "My Cart" screen, the user will be able to view the order history. This is done by opening the Modal window with a button like "View History" on the screen. The products purchased and the total amount paid will be displayed in the order history.

Similarly, products added to favorites must be saved in the device's memory. In short, order history and favorite products should not be deleted even if the application is opened and closed.
